##Project Abstract
*Please see separate "Project Overview" for full outline*
To appease the client desiring a AI that can identify Cats versus Dogs, Team 8 took the approach to fitting numerous model types to key selected features from the images, then determning which model performs best with those features.In a pursuit to find a model that best takes in 3 extracted features; color histograms, mean pixel brightness intensity value and the sum of the contour lines, Team 8 looked at four contributing factors to best determine the "good" model out of five models tested. These factors were accuracy of prediction, run time, ease of conceptual understanding, and parsimony/reproducability.
